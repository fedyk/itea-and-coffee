      <div class="full-event__topic-content">A short story about technology changes in the long term project and how to test it.
Are you a Front-End developer? Maybe not, but you might have heard about frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js, Meteor, Backbone or Aurelia. Have you ever tried to use any of them?
How about switching from one technology to another? Do you think that this is a mission impossible?
Maciej Adamczak, experienced WebUI developer, during his presentation, will tell you a short story about changes in a long-term project. Why rewriting something from scratch is a bad idea. And what should you do in order to convince your PM or client to use a different framework.
Since the framework is just a tool. Like a hammer. You can use it to build something. Or hurt yourself pretty badly.
It will not be a fairy tale.</div>
