      <div class="full-event__topic"><mark>-</mark> Test in the future – How to prepare?</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content">It took us over 100 years to add wheels to our suitcases. How much time and effort is needed to learn how to test new technologies? In 2015 one of the most popular themes for many testing events was about the technologies of the future. We discussed a lot what we can expect in the next 30 years but we didn’t talk how to test. For my presentation I chose examples on which I would like to show what issues we can face and few ideas how we should prepare for them.
      <br />
      The purpose of this presentation is to start discussion how we should prepare.

      <div class="full-event__topic"><mark>-</mark> Channels of information perception – how to use them</div>
      <div class="full-event__topic-content">Have you ever tried to explain simple stuff to other person and in the end he/she wouldn’t understand a thing?<br />
      Have you ever listened to the dialog and couldn’t remember it as good as when reading it out loud?<br/ >
      Have you ever thought WHY? <br />
      We will try to figure it out together during my presentation by walking through theory and practice: we’ll define WHAT ARE the channels of information perception and HOW TO use them to communicate our ideas better, faster and precisely.</div>
