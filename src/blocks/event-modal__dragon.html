      <div class="full-event__topic-content">With our friend, Piotr Czarnecki, experienced .Net developer will try to check out what new ideas have been explored and shared by Microsoft in new release of C# 7.0. Some of changes to the language will be presented in practice, based on simple examples (using Visual Studio 15 Preview IDE). We hope that after this short presentation, we all will know what new features we can expect from C# 7.0</div>

      <div class="full-event__topic-content">Most of us like nice smells. We would like to smell it long. Sometimes there is a bad smell around us and then we want to get away. Our colleague, Maciej Paruszewski, experienced Ruby developer / technical leader will help us to recognize the smell of the source code. This short presentation will be free of any specific technology and we believe that will be useful for all developers, testers or product managers.</div>
